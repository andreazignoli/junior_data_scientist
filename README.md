# Run

Execute src/main.py to run the exercise. You should be able to read the output:

```bash
Crude Death Rate (COPD) - United States: 2164.7 per 100,000 people
Crude Death Rate (COPD) - Uganda: 2058.6 per 100,000 people
Age-Standardized Death Rate (COPD) - United States: 8.5 per 100,000 people
Age-Standardized Death Rate (COPD) - Uganda: 68.0 per 100,000 people
```

# Explanation

The provided death rates for COPD in the US and Uganda show some differences:

Crude Death Rate (COPD) - United States: 2164.7 per 100,000 people
Crude Death Rate (COPD) - Uganda: 2058.6 per 100,000 people
Age-Standardized Death Rate (COPD) - United States: 8.5 per 100,000 people
Age-Standardized Death Rate (COPD) - Uganda: 68.0 per 100,000 people

The crude death rates represent the total number of deaths attributed to COPD per 100,000 people in each country, without considering age differences in the populations. The age-standardized death rates, on the other hand, account for the age distribution of the populations, allowing for a fair comparison between countries with different age distribution.

The difference between the crude death rates and the age-standardized death rates suggests that there may be differences in the age distributions of the populations. The age-standardized death rate for Uganda appears higher than that of the United States.

Overall, while the numbers seem plausible given the known disparities in healthcare access, environmental factors, and demographic profiles between the United States and Uganda, further analysis and contextual understanding would be needed to fully interpret these numbers.
